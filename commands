## Visual Mode

Press v to enter visual mode, this will also mark a starting selection point
Move the cursor to the desired end selection point; vim will provide a visual highlight of the text selection

V to enter visual line mode, this will make text selections by line
<C-V> to enter visual block mode, this will make text selections by blocks; moving the cursor will make rectangle selections of the text


The visual mode actually has multiple subtypes: visual, block-visual and linewise-visual

- visual: like described above. Enter by pressing v
- block-visual: select any rectangular region. Enter by pressing <ctrl>+v
- linewise-visual: always select full lines. Enter by pressing <shift>+v
    
## Command Mode

To enter command mode type ’:’ from normal mode and then type your command which should appear at the bottom of the window.

- : Enters command mode
- % Means across all lines
- s Means substitute
- /foo is regex to find things to replace
- /bar/ is regex to replace things with
- /g means global, otherwise it would only execute once per line
  
For example, to do a global find and replace type :%s/foo/bar/g to replace all ‘foo’ with ‘bar’

Vim has a number of other methods that you can read about in the help documentation, :h or :help.


## Replace Mode

Replace mode allows you replace existing text by directly typing over it. Before entering this mode, 
get into normal mode and put your cursor on top of the first character that you want to replace. 
Then press ‘R’ (capital R) to enter replace mode. Now whatever you type will replace the existing text. 
The cursor automatically moves to the next character just like in insert mode. The only difference is that every character you type will replace the existing one.
